			Automated decision making refers to the process of using algorithms and computer systems to make decisions or predictions without direct human intervention.
			It involves the use of AI techniques, machine learning algorithms, and other computational methods to analyze data, detect patterns, and make decisions based on predefined rules or models.
		
		<h4>Some examples of systems with Automated Decision Making:</h4>
			<ul> 
				<li>Smart Home Devices</li>
				<li>Social Media Feeds</li>
				<li>Antivirus</li>
				<li>Music Streaming Recommendations</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h4>Benefits and Opportunities</h4>
			
			<h2>Accuracy and Consistency</h2>
				Automated systems can perform tasks with a high level of accuracy, minimizing human errors and inconsistencies that may arise from manual decision-making.
			
			<h2>Efficiency and Speed</h2>
					Automated decision-making systems can process and analyze vast amounts of data in much less time than it would take for humans to do so manually. 					
					This means that overall it is much more efficient compared to human input.
		
		<h4>Risks and Threats</h4>
			
			<h2>Potential Errors and Malfunctions</h2>
				In the case that a system may have some errors this could cause it to malfunction. 
				For example, if there are errors on the filtering algorithm on a social media application, then explicit or undesired content could be reccomended on peoples feeds.
			
			<h2>Bias and Discrimination</h2> 
				Many automated decision-making algorithms are extremely advanced meaning they lack transparency and explainability. 
				This can make it difficult to understand how decisions are reached, limiting accountability and making it challenging to identify and address where any biases or errors occur.

			<h2>Replacing Human Occupations</h2>
				As these systems become more advanced through time they can make traditional human jobs in several industries obselete.
				This benefits companies as they have less employees on the payroll however, for employees this means that many will lose their employment due to these systems.
				Jobs such as factory workers are often no longer required as robots can perform these tasks using an algorithm.
