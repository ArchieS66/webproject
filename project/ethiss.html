				<h2> Censorship and The Internet </h2>
					Technology can be used to censor the media and influence people using bias.
					This rasies ethical concerns as some corrupt governments may use technology to control the media using propaganda.
					By restricting the content that people see and the activity on the internet this can allow political parties to have unfair and bias advantages over others if some are being exclusively depicted positively or negatively.
					This can lead to citizens being brainwashed and that governments can have practically total control over a nations media such as in countries like North Korea or China.
					This will also raise more ethical issues as the right to free speech is a protected human right in many countries.
					North Korea uses extreme censorship with civillians not being allowed to access the internet and if users want to play video games they have to play on a heavily restricted version to prevent them from communicating with people from other nations.

				<h2>Monitoring Behavior</h2>
					Using technology to monitor behavior has been utilized in some countries around the world.
					The most notable is China where they use this technology track citizens activity online and even in person.
					China is regarded as one of the most advanced technological countries and is the most surveillanced country in the world.
					Several Chinese companies such as Megvii, CloudWalk, and Yitu have made facial recognition commonplace in China, where police scan public spaces for suspects, and citizens pay in stores and pay taxes with their faces.
					This has raised several global concerns about the privacy of citizens with technology as right to privacy or private life is included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
				
				<h2>Analysis of Personal Information</h2>
					Using technology to gather personal information about people could potentially raise ethical concerns.
					Obtaining informed consent from individuals before collecting their data is crucial. 
					Analysts must clearly communicate the purpose, scope, and potential risks associated with data collection and analysis, allowing individuals to make an informed decision about participating otherwise this is an invasion of privacy.
					The storage and transmission of personal information should be in a secured location to prevent unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse. 
					The owner of the collected data could use it for unethical purposes which also raises concerns over ones privacy.

				<h2>Piracy and Offensive Communications</h2>
					Technology can often be used to commit illegalities such as priacy which is the unauthorised copying of content.
					The software and websites that advertise the free content sometimes may contain malware which can be harmful to users devices and can be used to collect personal data.
					Piracy and offensive communications also violates the rights of creators and deprives them of fair compensation for their work.
