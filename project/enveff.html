			<h2>There are many environmental impacts of computers and technology as a whole</h2> <br>
			<div class = "image2"> <img src="images/pollution.jpg", width="320" height="200"> </div>
			
			<h2>Pollution</h2>
				The production of technology can cause air pollution which is when harmful or excessive quantities of gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide and methane are released into the atmosphere. <br><br><br><br>
			
			<h2>Natrual Resource Depletion</h2>
				<div class = "image"> <img src="images/matextract.jpg", width="300" height="175"> </div>
				There are lots of natrual resources used in the production of technology.
				Computers are made up of over 30 different minerals which are finite resources meaning that we only have a limited amount of these raw materials on Earth.
				We extract large quantities of these resources for manufacturing purposes which is detremental to the environment.
			
			<h2>Volatile Materials</h2>	
				Some of the materials used in the production of technology are regarded as hazardous and toxic such as lithium.
				If a human is exposed to lithium it can cause headaches, muscle weakness, twitching, blurred vision, nausea and seizures.
				Lithium ion batteries are extremely sensetive and exposure to high temperatures can cause large fires that are difficult to extinguish. <br><br>

			<h2>Energy Consumption</h2> 
				Modern technology requires a substantial amount of energy to operate. 
				This increased energy consumption in computers has led to a higher rate at which we are mining for fuels like coal and oil to facilitate the new devices.
				Thankfully, the development of renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind, offers potential solutions to reduce energy-related environmental impacts.
