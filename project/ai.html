		AI or Artificial Intelligence are machines designed and created by humans that are meant to emulate human charecteristics or intelligence.
		Advanced descision making is something that most AI have as a means of effectively performing human instructions.
		
		<h4>Some examples of Artificial Intelligence include:</h4>
			<ul> 
				<li>Virtual Assistants (such as Alexa or Google Pixel)</li>
				<li>Self Driving Veichles</li>
				<li>Robots</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h4>Benefits and Opportunities</h4>

			<h2>Solving Complex Problems</h2>
				Artificial Intelligence can be used to solve complex arithmetic problems in a more efficient timespace than it would take humans.
				Some mathmatical problems are so long and complex that they can only be performed by a computer and if a human were to attempt it then it would be very tedious.
			
			<h2>Productivity</h2>
				AI negates all of the needs of a human therefore, it is more productive as it does not have to take breaks and can operate permanently.
			
		<h4>Issues and Potential Risks</h4>
			
			<h2>Regulatory and Legal Challenges</h2> 
			<p>
				The rapid development of AI has outpaced the establishment of comprehensive regulations and legal frameworks. 
				There is a need to address issues related to liability, accountability, transparency, and data protection to ensure responsible and ethical AI development and use.

			<h2>Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
				One field where AI is advancing is for military applications.
				As AI is originally programmed by human intelligence they can select the purpose of the system therefore, some developers could design systems that are designed to inflict pain on others which is against international law.
